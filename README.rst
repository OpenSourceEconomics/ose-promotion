We present background material on our initiative. We provide a platform for economists, mathematicians, and computational scientists to facilitate the transdisciplinary collaboration in the development, analysis, and application of computational economic models. Together, we expand the set of possible economic questions that we can address and improve the quality of our answers.

This material is under constant development but you can access its most recent version `here <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-promotion/blob/master/promotion>`_.
